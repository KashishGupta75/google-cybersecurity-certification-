# MODULE 2 :- HISTORY CYBERSECURITY ATTACK

## PAST OF CYBER-ATTACK‚ÄôS

   A computer virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. 

- In 1986, the Alvi brothers created the Brain virus, although the intention of the virus was to track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licenses, what the virus actually did was unexpected. Once a person used a pirated copy of the software, the virus-infected that computer. Then, any disk that was inserted into the computer was also infected. The virus spread to a new computer every time someone used one of the infected disks. Undetected, the virus spread globally within a couple of months.
- the first cyber - attack in world ?
- 

### üêõ Morris Worm (1988) ‚Äì First Major Cyber Attack

- **Who**: Created by **Robert Tappan Morris**, a graduate student at Cornell University.
- **What**: A self-replicating computer worm that infected thousands of computers on the **ARPANET** (the early form of the internet).
- **Impact**:
    - Estimated to have infected **6,000+ systems**, about **10% of the internet** at the time.
    - Caused **millions of dollars** in damages.
    - Led to **massive slowdowns and system failures**.
- **Aftermath**:
    - Morris was **prosecuted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act**.
    - He became the **first person convicted** under this act.

## ATTACK IN DIGITAL-AGE..

SOCIAL ENGINEERING is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

EXAMPLE :- ‚ÄúI LOVE YOU ‚Äú AND ‚ÄúEQUIFAX‚Äù

      In the year 2000, Onel De Guzman created the LoveLetter malware to steal internet login credentials. This attack spread rapidly and took advantage of people who had not developed a healthy suspicion for unsolicited emails. Users received an email with the subject line, "I Love You." Each email contained an attachment labeled, "Love Letter For You." When the attachment was opened, the malware scanned a user's address book. Then, it automatically sent itself to each person on the list and installed a program to collect user information and passwords. Recipients would think they were receiving an email from a friend, but it was actually malware. The LoveLetter ended up infecting 45 million computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages. The LoveLetter attack is the first example of social engineering.

        Now, let's discuss the Equifax breach. In 2017, attackers successfully infiltrated the credit reporting agency, Equifax. This resulted in one of the largest known data breaches of sensitive information. Over 143 million customer records were stolen, and the breach affected approximately 40% of all American .

VARIOUS METHOD OF ATTACKS =

1. Malware = to harm the software.
2. virus = inject its own code to infect the computer or data .
3. worm = comes form infected computer (multiply itself )
4. spyware = collect the userdata and sell it without their permission
5. ransomware = attacker spread the virus and demand moneyt o fix it  
6. phishing =  use digital communicaion to trick the user .
7. spear-phishing = email based
8. whale = A form of spear phishing , like a whale has some sells attached to it which gain the food when whale eat the fish .
9. business email compromise  = **email based attack**
10. vishing = The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
11. social engineering :- **Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question.
12. social media phishing :-**collect a data form social media and use against user**
13. watering hole attack = attack only most visited website by user
14.  Physical  social engineering = is a type of cyber attack where the attacker **manipulates people in the real world** to gain **physical access** to systems, data, or infrastructure.
15. usb = by USB drive attack 

## THE EIGHT CIISP DOMAIN ‚ûñ

CIIPS = Critical Infrastructure Information Protection System

1. Security and Risk management = this domain is for managing the risk and security in 
2. Asset security = this domain focan on securing digital and physical asset also for maintaining the storge ,retention , destroying the data.
3. Security architecture and engineering = This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place .
4. communication and network security = This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. 
5. Identity and access management = by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
6. Security assetmeant and testing = this domain make sure to take a test of security asset test to ensure the safety  and any further  risk  collecting and analyzing the data .
7. Security operation = . This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
8. Software development security = This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services

# Determine the type of attack

Previously, you learned about the eight Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) security domains. The domains can help you better understand how a security analyst's job duties can be organized into categories. Additionally, the domains can help establish an understanding of how to manage risk. In this reading, you will learn about additional methods of attack. You‚Äôll also be able to recognize the types of risk these attacks present.

![Graphic of the eight icons that represent the CISSP security domains.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/fJ0g68UxToW3OSJob2ecKg_30973561259c420c8fe8ae7697cf10f1_CS_R-021_Security-domains.png?expiry=1752019200000&hmac=RBVTMaCZCv3FeVXovu3j8WGdLgoW2WWiF4bLBnlpEbc)

## **Attack types**

### **Password attack**

A **password attack** is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you‚Äôll learn about later in the certificate program are:

- Brute force
- Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

### **Social engineering attack**

**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:

- Phishing
- Smishing
- Vishing
- Spear phishing
- Whaling
- Social media phishing
- Business Email Compromise (BEC)
- Watering hole attack
- USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting
- Physical social engineering

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

### **Physical attack**

A **physical attack** is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

- Malicious USB cable
- Malicious flash drive
- Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.

### **Adversarial artificial intelligence**

**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

### **Supply-chain attack**

A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

### **Cryptographic attack**

A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are:

- Birthday
- Collision
- Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain

Threat actor :- person or group of people who  intentionally harm the system.

## TYPE -OF - ATTACKERS

| threat actor type  | Definition  |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Advanced persistent threat  | Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources

Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents |
| 2.  Insider threat | insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

Sabotage

Corruption

Espionage

Unauthorized data access or leaks  |

| 3.  Hacktivists | Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

Demonstrations

Propaganda

Social change campaigns

Fame |
| --- | --- |
| 4. Hackers  | A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data.  There are three main categories of hackers:

Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.

Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don‚Äôt take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain |

COMPONENTS OF SECURITY FRAMWORK 

1. identifying and documenting security goals 
2. setting guidelines to achieve security goals  
3. implementing strong security processes 
4. monitoring and communicating result 
- security control :- Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. For example, your company may have a guideline that requires all employees to complete a privacy training to reduce the risk of data breaches.

## CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental model in **cybersecurity** used to guide policies for **information security**.

CIA = Confidentiality integrity  availability 

### üîê **C ‚Äì Confidentiality**

COMPLIANCE :- Compliance is the process of making sure an organization is doing what it's supposed to do.

### ‚úÖ Examples:

- Following data protection laws like GDPR.
- Making sure employees follow cybersecurity policies.
- Keeping records as required by financial regulations.

# Controls, frameworks, and compliance

Previously, you were introduced to security frameworks and how they provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. As a reminder, a security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards. In this reading, you will learn more about how security frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations‚Äîor laws‚Äîare used together to manage security and make sure everyone does their part to minimize risk.

## **How controls, frameworks, and compliance are related**

The **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad** is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

[A triangle representing the CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) triad](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tRYBVP2USbGPopkOfhzPpw_6ab653e71a614420b313c9e7675893f1_PULBC_YPYaRtzxvZUx-luk79t2pB_kZEoF2XeW17w6D2BekL7XaIUhCIAf65kNzAZU-WXYJ6IwhMr_jwiPhYMd2kWk5TyfeNFUy4ax3hyj_fJbtGSEw4UB0bzaA-E-gKD5tG8yud6Q2kmQFomLoF4CGW-0cCnhAyOvriAcCqrRKDlJMkaNOReSToFqs5I_cjfFOVTU9cmwiYyFETx2_4Gbf80z4rpW3ioqxBAw?expiry=1752105600000&hmac=uPoxyo068qDr2vxMniYPIqV5EYWb3qQ1YCS9ugazi8Y)

CIA are the three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to establish appropriate controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

As you may recall, **security** **controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So they are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

**Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing strong security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

## üîê **Counterattacks, Ethics, and Laws in Cybersecurity ‚Äì Simple Guide**

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è **What is a Counterattack in Cybersecurity?**

A **counterattack** is when a person or organization **fights back** against a hacker or attacker by hacking them in return.

### üö´ **Why Are Counterattacks a Problem?**

- **They are usually illegal** (especially in the U.S.).
- They can **make the situation worse** (more damage, more attacks).
- If you attack a **foreign hacker**, it could lead to **international conflict**.
- Only the **government or military** is allowed to do counterattacks legally in the U.S.

---

## üá∫üá∏ **United States View on Counterattacks**

### üîç **Key Laws:**

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)**: Makes hacking and unauthorized access illegal‚Äîeven for revenge.
- **Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (2015)**: Encourages info-sharing about threats, but does **not allow retaliation**.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Bottom Line:**

- You can **defend** your network.
- But you **can‚Äôt hack back**. It‚Äôs considered **vigilantism** (taking the law into your own hands).

---

## üåê **International View on Counterattacks**

According to **International Court of Justice (ICJ)**:

A counterattack is **only allowed** if:

1. It **only affects the attacker**.
2. It‚Äôs more like a **warning or message**, not a harmful action.
3. It doesn‚Äôt **make the situation worse**.
4. It can be **undone or reversed**.

üëâ These rules are very hard to follow in real life. That‚Äôs why most organizations **avoid counterattacking**.

üìò To learn more: Look up the **Tallinn Manual** (a guide for cyber warfare laws).

---

## üß† **Ethical Cybersecurity Principles**

Even when laws don‚Äôt give clear answers, cybersecurity pros follow **ethical frameworks** like:

### üîê **CIA Triad:**

1. **Confidentiality** ‚Äì Only the right people can see private data.
2. **Integrity** ‚Äì Data is accurate and not changed.
3. **Availability** ‚Äì Systems and data are accessible when needed.

---

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Privacy and Data Protection**

Security pros must protect:

- **PII** (Personally Identifiable Info): Like your name, email, or phone.
- **SPII** (Sensitive PII): Like Social Security Numbers, credit card info, or health data.

These types of data can be used to **steal identity or commit fraud**, so professionals must keep them safe.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Your Ethical Duties as a Cybersecurity Professional**

You must:

‚úÖ Be **honest, responsible, and unbiased**

‚úÖ **Follow the law** and don‚Äôt misuse your access

‚úÖ Stay **educated and updated** on tech and laws

‚úÖ Help your organization be **secure and ethical**

---

### üí° **Example: HIPAA**

HIPAA is a U.S. law that protects **patient health information**.

As a security professional, you must:

- Make sure health data is safe
- Inform patients if their data is stolen
- Follow both **legal** and **ethical** rules

---

## ‚úÖ Final Advice:

- **Don‚Äôt hack back** ‚Äî even if you're attacked.
- **Follow the law and ethical principles.**
- Your job is to **protect, not punish**.
- Keep learning and improving your skills
